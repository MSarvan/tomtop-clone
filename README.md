# TOMTOP CLONE

### For Educational And Learning Purpose*

Project: Make a clone of Tomtop website.

Tomtop is a cross-border e-commerce platform that provides products all over the world through several channels. It is based in Long Gang, China.
<br><br>
In this project I have tried to manipulate dom elements, styling using CSS and tried to make website more dynamic and responsive. With my efforts and the technology stack, that I have learned till now in Unit-3 in the masai school, I was able to clone the whole website with same looking & features.
